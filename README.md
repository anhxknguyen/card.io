A flashcard website built using almost all of T3 stack ( without tRPC =/ )

Libraries, Tools, and Frameworks:
- **Next 14** => react but better lol
- **TypeScript** => for type safety
- **Prisma (MySQL)** => for database storage
- **NextAuth** => for authentication purposes 
- **TailwindCSS + shadcn/ui** => for ui 
- **zod** => for form schema validation
- **react-hook-form** => for form validation

Deployments don't work right now because I haven't migrated my local db to any hosting services yet :p
